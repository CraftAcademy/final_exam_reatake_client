# Service Search Challenge 

You are challenged with the task of building a list and search interface and test it with Cypress IO. It is a desktop- and mobile web application listing available community services using the Kensington & Chelsea Social Council API. 

## API URL

```
https://kcsc-api.herokuapp.com/api/
```
## Endpoints

Collection of available services
```
GET /api/services
```

Search interface
```
POST /api/search?q=<search term>
```


You need to fork this repository and clone it down to your local computer. Implement the challenge in your forked repository. Make sure to branch off and to open up a WIP pull request to this repository as soon as possible.

Remember to commit often!


You need to fetch the data from the Viaplay API and find the appropriate attributes that hold the information you need. 

## The style

We want you to make the dicision of what sort of css you want to use and how much styling you add to the application. It is part of the challenge to make the applications responsive in order to be properly displayed on both dektop computers as well as on tablets and cell phones.



**Good luck and Happy Coding.**
